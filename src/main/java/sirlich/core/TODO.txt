This text file will serve as something of a TODO for myself:
	Dropped items:
		Add better models
		Make a runable that runs every five minutes, placing the correct item at the correct loc. This will requre configs.
	Learn particles. 
		Remove particles when it hits on ground
	Wand system using diamond shovel?
	
Better TODO:
	Remove bad particles on the spells
	Handle spell hitting the ground
	Stop XP glitch where getting XP at max level boosts your level
	Add particle train to spells
	Model 3 wand types
	Switch SpellHit into a damageEvent
	Make a better DamageEvent that calls to other classes/methods
